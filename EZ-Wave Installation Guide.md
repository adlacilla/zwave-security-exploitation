## Initial Setup
	The process of installing EZ-Wave is as follows:
First, you need to be on a Linux machine running Ubuntu 14.04. In order to do this, I downloaded Oracle VM VirtualBox and got a disc image of Ubuntu 14.04 from the Ubuntu website. VirtualBox walks through setting up a VM. I dedicated 3GB of RAM and 20GB of Hard disc space for the VM however, more for both is recommended. 
Once the VM is installed, run it. It will run through its own setup process and restart. You will have to set a username and password. My username was Lacilla and my password was Password. When setup is complete, you are ready to begin getting the necessary dependencies for EZ Wave.
Finally, make sure you are connected to the internet as some of these processes require an internet connection to function.

## Requirements

### Python
To begin, open the terminal and type the following line: sudo apt-get install python2.7
This will install the necessary python version needed for EZ Wave as stated on their Github page. This can be seen in the screenshot below.
 
 ### Gnuradio 
	The next step is to install gnuradio. The easiest way to do this and have the proper version is to run the following line: wget http://www.sbrac.org/files/build-gnuradio && chmod a+x build-gnuradio && ./build-gnuradio 
It will then show a paragraph and ask if you want to proceed. Type yes. It will then ask if you have sudo privileges. Type yes and enter password if prompted. When done correctly, it will look like this:  
I moved my location to the Downloads folder in order to keep things in one place not at root. 
When it finishes checking for all necessary packages, it will ask if it is ok to fetch Gnu Radio via git. Type yes. 

### Wireshark
The next step is to install wireshark. It is specified on the EZ-Wave repo that any version between 1.12 and 2.0.1 will work. I chose to install 2.0.1 to have the newest wireshark possible. The instructions being followed can be found at this link: https://scottlinux.com/2013/06/07/how-to-install-the-latest-wireshark-from-source-on-debian-or-ubuntu-linux/

In order to begin, first you must grab the tar file of the version of wireshark you want from the wireshark source file download list here: https://1.na.dl.wireshark.org/src/all-versions/
Once the correct version is downloaded, you need to install some dependencies using the command: sudo apt-get build-dep wireshark.
